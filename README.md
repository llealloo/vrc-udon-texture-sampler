# vrc-udon-texture-sampler
A scene setup example of how to get pixel data from a render texture into VRChat Udon

# Required packages
- VRChat World SDK 3.0
- UdonSharp

# Notes
The blank "Tex2D.png" asset should match the pixel dimensions of the render texture. You will have to do this manually in an external image editing application such as photoshop/gimp. It serves as a placeholder Texture2D asset as a workaround for missing features within Udon. This may become depreciated in the future.
